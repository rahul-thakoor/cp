# cp
A better `cargo publish`
It is a WIP project inspired by [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np)

## Why?
This tool aims to automate checks before trying to publish a crate for the first time. 

Features
- Check if crate name is available on crates.io
- Ensures mandatory metadata in Cargo.toml are provided
- more to come...
